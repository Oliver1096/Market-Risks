# Market-Risks


* Price Risk: This relates to uncertain changes in the underlying's price, like index, commodity, foreign exchange, or stock movements.
* Volatility risk: Volatility refers to uncertain
* Interest rate risk: Although equity derivatives generally do not rely on interest rates or bonds directly their value is indirectly influenced by interest rates via risk-neutral discounting with the short rate.
* Liquidity risk: Dynamic and static hedging strategies depend on market liquidity; for example, if certain options are not liquidity traded a desired hedge may not be executable.
* Correlation risk: Simply spoken, correlation measures the co-movement of two or more assets/quantities; correlation may change over time and become close to 1, i.e. perfect, among asset classes during times of stress.
* Jump or chash risk: the stock market crashes of 1987, 1998, 2001, and 2008 as well as implied volatilities of stock index options indicate that there is a significantly positive probability for large market drops; such discontinuities may break down, for example, otherwise sound dynamic hedging strategies.
* Default risk: In case of the default of a company represented in the underlying assets, stocks and/or bonds of this company depreciate in value.
